Degree centrality is defined as the number of links to events on a node. For "best friends ", more central students were more popular. So according to these figures shown in the video, we can intuitively find out the students who have the highest Closeness value. Student 21 has the highest closeness centrality in "bestfriends" network. Student 14 and 16 have the highest closeness centrality in the measure. Student 21 has the highest closeness centrality in "workwith" network.
