# The-Social-Network-Analysis

The purpose of the project is to generate a basic sociogram and interpret centrality measures and clustering procedures from it. 

It depicts the network structure of nodes and bonds, edges, or connections to them to investigate social structures. It allows us to find some of the most characteristic origins (nodes).

In the project, I will build a variety of different social networks that focus on feature. Then visually find out the connection between closeness, betweeness centralities, mutual connections, vertices, groups(cliques) and graphical analysis objects.

Degree centrality is defined as the number of links to events on a node. For "best friends ", more central students were more popular. So according to these figures shown in the video, we can intuitively find out the students who have the highest Closeness value. Student 21 has the highest closeness centrality in "bestfriends" network. Student 14 and 16 have the highest closeness centrality in the measure. Student 21 has the highest closeness centrality in "workwith" network.
